# NetworkDirect SPI

The NetworkDirect architecture provides application developers with a networking interface that enables zero-copy data transfers between applications, kernel-bypass I/O generation and completion processing, and one-sided data transfer operations. The NetworkDirect service provider interface (SPI) defines the interface that NetworkDirect providers implement to expose their hardware capabilities to applications.

Please find additional documentation in [docs/](./docs) folder.

NetworkDirect SDK is available in [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/networkdirect) also.

# Building

## Using cmake

- md build
- cd build
  - Run cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
  - cmake --build . --target dmrpingpong
  
## Using bprep and bbld
- bprep // Run this to create a build directory and runs cmake -G for VS
- bbcl <projectname> // using this to build specific projects like dmrpingpong
- dmping bld is broken

## Prerequisites

 - [Visial Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)

   Please make sure to select the following workloads during installation:
    - .NET desktop development (required for CBT/Nuget packages)
    - Desktop development with C++ 

 - [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
 - [Windows WDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
 
 Based on the installed VS/SDK/WDK versions, update _VCToolsVersion_ and _WindowsTargetPlatformVersion_ in Directory.Build.props
 
 Note that the build system uses [CommonBuildToolSet(CBT)](https://commonbuildtoolset.github.io/). You may need to unblock __CBT.core.dll__ (under .build/CBT) depending on your security configurations. Please refer to [CBT documentation](https://commonbuildtoolset.github.io/#/getting-started) for additional details.


 ## Build
 To build, open a __Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio__ and  run ``msbuild`` from root folder.
